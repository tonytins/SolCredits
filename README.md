# Solar Credits (working title)

<img src="screenshot.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

Made in Godot 4.x and inspired by Stellaris, Solar Credits explores the concept of earning money using renewable energy to earn Credits (Ȼ). This prototype is fairly simple in design. You own a simple household that has solar panels. When your battery reaches 100%, energy production temporarily halts, and you earn the sum of the total energy stored. Then it begins depleting until a certain minimum threshold is reached, and the cycle repeats. In the future, you'll be able to purchase more solar panels or batteries from a marketplace in order to increase power and capacity.

## To-do

- [ ] Day-night cycle

- [ ] 3D enviroment

## Surplus of Potential

While much of this premise is fictional, don't get me wrong, this is technically already a feasible today. You can sell surplus for money in real life. Actually, it is a good motivation to get solar panels in the first place. So it isn't that far-fetched. This game just expands upon that concept by making the very act of generating energy your universal basic income instead. Selling the surplus shouldn't be an option, but a guarantee.
